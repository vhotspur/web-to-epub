# web-to-epub: convert web pages to e-book from command-line

This tool downloads the web page given as an argument and converts it
to a standalone EPUB file.

It has a rudimentary support for extraction of the most interesting part
of the page through XSL conversion.

This is work-in-progress tool, bugs may (and will) occur ;-).
